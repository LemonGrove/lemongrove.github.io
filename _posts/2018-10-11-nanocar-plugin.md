I made a molecular car builder plug-in for Avogadro 2 as part of my MolSSI fellowship project.
The plug-in available in GitHub [here](https://github.com/kbsezginel/nanocar-avogadro).

**Watch the tutorial here**

Currently the main functionalities are:
- Adding a chassis molecule
- Connecting wheel molecule
- Building a metal surface to place the Nanocar

This plug-in is a part of molecular CAD tool I want to develop to build and design artificial molecular machines. Any feedback is appreciated!

You can create an issue on GitHub or just send an e-mail.
