## Young Turkish scientist aims to be a pioneer
**Kutay Sezginel, who is doing a PhD in computational materials design aims to be a pioneer by digitizing world's first nanocar race.**

Scientists say that nanotechnology will bring many technological advancements.
These days they not only design molecular machines but also organize a nanocar race to measure their performance.
The first nanocar race was organized in 2017 in France with 6 teams moving their molecules using special electron microscopes.
The purpose of the nanocar race is to improve our ability to control matter at a very very small scale.
Kutay Berk Sezginel (29), who is doing a PhD in computational materials design at University of Pittsburgh developed a software to help design nanocars.

### Looking for Support
Sezginel is organizing a computational version of the nanocar race and he is currently looking for support.
Sezginel said *"I think it would be amazing to spearhead such a race as Turkish scientists and I think it would greatly benefit our country. We named the organization Formula Nano, you can check out our website at [formulanano.com](https://formulanano.com/)*."
