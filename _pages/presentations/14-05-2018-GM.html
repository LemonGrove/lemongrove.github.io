## Molecular Diffusion

For example, diffusion in zeolites occur outside the time scales accesible to molecular dynamics simulations,
which is typically limited to diffusion rates in the order of 10<sup>-12</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/s.

## Transition State Theory (TST)
If the system is characterized by a sequence of rare events than it can be described using TST.

### Arrhenius Equation (1889)
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/presentations/arrhenius-equation.svg" alt="arrhenius" height=50></p>

A historically useful generalization supported by Arrhenius' equation is that, for many common
chemical reactions at room temperature, the reaction rate doubles for every 10 degree Celsius increase in temperature.
Moore's Law of chemical engineering.

Mainly used to calculate activation energy by measuring temperature dependence of a rate constant.
Useful in thermally induced processes such as diffusion.

### Eyring Equation (1935)
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/presentations/eyring-equation.svg" alt="eyring" height=60></p>

---
## Transmission coefficient
The transmission coefficient is used in physics and electrical engineering when wave propagation in a medium containing discontinuities is considered.
An electromagnetic (or any other) wave experiences partial transmittance and partial reflectance when the medium through which it travels suddenly changes.

## dcTST (Dynamically Corrected Transition State Theory)

Enables calculation of self-diffusion coefficients for systems far beyond the time scales accessible to molecular dynamics.

## Procedure
- Initially the smallest repeating lattice is divided into grid points.

<img src="/assets/img/presentations/us-fcc-110-grid.png" alt="us-fcc-110-x" height=230>

For each grid point a MD simulation is performed.
First I performed a minimization on each grid point (2eps).
Then I also tried umbrella sampling with a spring (2eps | NVT | 200K)

### Activation Energy
- The barriers obtained using WHAM analysis are around 0.15 kcal/mol.
- The experimental activation energy for HtBDC is 0.57 eV which is approximately 13 kcal/mol.
- This means we are 2 orders of magnitude lower.
- Let's bump up the interaction energy.

## LAMMPS

#### US - Minimization
Calculate min energy and distance for each point

#### US - NVT & Spring (eps: 5)
Attached spring (k:5 kcal/mol) to each point and performed NVT simulations for 5 ns (dt: 1 fs).
Performed WHAM analysis which resulted in barriers ~0.15 kca/mol.
The activation energy of the molecule is 0.57 eV which corresponds to ~13 kcal/mol.
This suggests that surface-molecule interaction energy should be ~100 times larger.

#### US - NVT & Spring (eps: 500)
This resulted in molecule to explode (bonded atoms becoming too far apart).
This is presumably because the molecule is initially placed ~5 A above the surface and with the NVT
simulation the molecule is attracted to the surface with so much speed that the atoms just gain too much velocity.
This veolcity is however different for each atom therefore they might fly apart from each other losing bonds.
This can be alleviated by minimizing the system first.

Moreover by changing the epsilon coefficient the equilibrium z-distance might be changed.
Instead of using the same z position for the spring, for these simulations I decided to use the last z position from the minimization.

# Mean Squared Displacement

Mean squared displacement is calculated using the formula below:

<img src="assets/img/msd/msd_equation.png" alt="msd-equation" height=150>

where N is the number of timesteps, r(t) is the position of particle at time t and dt is time delta.

In order to understand the type of diffusion one can calculate MSD for different timedelta values
and plot MSD vs dt.

---
### MSD vs dt

The shape of the MSd vs dt curve gives information about the type of the motion of the particle.
For true random walk (brownian motion) a linear line is expected.
If there are other forces affecting the motion of the particle then different behaviours can be expected.

## WHAM

k formula:
k_{A \rightarrow B} = \kappa {\sqrt{ \dfrac{1}{2 \pi M \beta}}} \dfrac{ e^{- \beta F(q^*)} } { \int e^{- \beta F(q)}dq }
