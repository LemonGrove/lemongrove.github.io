I do research, sort of. I mean I think I do but sometimes when I see people doing really cool
and complicated stuff I fell kinda lost. I do like making cool figures though.
If you want to see some research go ahead!

## [Discovering Hetero-Interpenetrated MOFs](https://github.com/kbsezginel/IPMOF)
Some pretty crystalline materials.

## [Loading Drugs in MOFs](https://kbsezginel.github.io/biomof)
Not the fun ones though, the serious ones. Like the ones that cure cancer and stuff.

## [Nanocars!](https://kbsezginel.github.io/Nanocar)
Just some molecules jiggling on a surface.

## [Moleidoscope](https://github.com/kbsezginel/Moleidoscope)
Like a kaleidoscope but with molecules. I know that doesn't make much sense.

## [Thermal conductivity of MOFs](https://kbsezginel.github.io/tee_mof)
This is serious.

## [HostDesigner](https://github.com/kbsezginel/HostDesigner)
A Python wrapper for HostDesigner (also serious).

## [Computational Chemistry Tools Tutorials](https://kbsezginel.github.io/chem-tools-tutorials/)
Tutorials and scripts for several computational chemistry and visualization tools.
