So, here's how it works:

1.  You aim to share one piece of YOUR ORIGINAL ART everyday. It is a hard challenge!

2.  The art can take any form (drawing, photography, graphic, music, dance, film, animation, food, recipe, scientific illustration, math equation,...)

3.  You can partner up and do collaborative projects!
