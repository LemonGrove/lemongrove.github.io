My initial goal was to find a platform where I can use BCH to share/monetize my music and listen/buy music. Maybe a platform like [bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/) or [spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/) that accepts BCH or other cryptocurrencies. However, to my surprise this doesn't seem to possible at the moment. Obviously, you can always share your BCH address in basically any platform (as I do on [my website](https://kbsezginel.github.io/music/)) but this is both not ideal and it doesn't let you *sell* your music.

I realized this isn't really possible

but I
, tip fellow musicians and receive Bitcoin Cash tips.
Obviously, you can always share your address in any platform (as I do [my website](https://kbsezginel.github.io/music/)
put a QR code, or share your address in any other platform (e.g. soundcloud, youtube, ...) but I wanted to see if someplace exists where you can also sell music for BCH if you wanted to. Quickly I realized that doesn't really exist and more suprisingly you cannot really do this with any cryptocurrency. I then started reading about all the new music platforms that use some blockchain. At this moment most of them just seem to have a token and nothing else but they all promise to revolutionize music industry. Here is a list of the projects I found if anyone is interested:

- [ujomusic](https://www.ujomusic.com/)
- [choon](https://www.choon.co/)
- [musicoin](https://musicoin.org/)
- [Revelator](https://revelator.com/)
- [Mycelia](http://myceliaformusic.org/)
- [imusify](https://imusify.com/)
- [Audius](https://audius.co/index.html)
- [Voise](https://www.voise.com/)
- [Res()nate](https://resonate.is/)

The two most useful ones I think are ujomusic and choon which actually have music on their platform that you can listen to. I am not trying to bash all these projects, as some of them had very successful fundraisers such as Auidus who [raised $5.5 million](https://www.coindesk.com/decentralized-music-sharing-platform-raises-5-5m-in-series-a). However, I think I was disappointed to

## Musicoin

First of all, I don't like that they have their own Blockchain and token but that's just a personal opinion.
My real issue with Musicoin is that it was kind of a pain to setup. They ask you to provide some social media account (Google, Twitter or Facebook) which they use to verify who you are.
I understand this might be important to detect frauds who might try to make money with someone else's music but it also makes the whole process unattractive to say the least.
My other problem is their interface is suboptimal. You can only upload songs one by one and their server is painstakingly slow.
I spent over an hour to setup a profile and verify my account so I can upload a song but to no avail.

## choon

Choon was relatively easy to sign up, it only requires an email address.
However it got a little harder after that.
After trying to figure out how to upload a track for 5 minutes I realized that you cannot upload tracks before you are approved.
So, I cannot comment on how easy it is to upload tracks and release an album but UX is definitelly better than musicoin.
Choon uses *NOTES* token (ETH) and you can connect your MetaMask wallet to their system.
I am still not a big fan of using specific tokens but seems like a better idea than creating a separate blockchain.
Also, even though I couldn't upload songs you can still create playlists from other people's tracks and there are many artists and songs in their website which looks promising.

The interesting feature in Choon is you can split your earnings with playlist curators. For each of your tracks, you can pick any percentage you want and that much of the streaming revenue goes to the curator. This is a very nice way to incentivize people to add your tracks to their playlist and in turn you can get more exposure.

## ujomusic

This is my favorite. Super easy to sign up, you can regiester multiple music groups if you like and distribute revenue among multiple people.
Similar to choon, ujomusic also connects to your MetaMask wallet and even better it directly uses ETH instead of a custom token.
There are still things that can be improved, for example you cannot like tracks or save them without purchasing.
It would be nice to still like tracks or add them to something like wishlist for future purchases.
I have to play with it more but I think it looks promising.

Allows sharing
Cannot buy tracks separately
cannot remove release

Signing up was super easy and the UI is very slick, looks more professional and modern.
One of the nice futures is it can generate html code so you can embed a player to your webpage.

There are many other projects that focus on other topics related to music industry such as creating open-source protocols for music rights and publishing or there are sites that allow musicians to do ISOs (Initial Song Offering). You can see a comprehensive list of these projects [here](https://medium.com/singulardtv/the-state-of-music-and-blockchain-2018-a13eb6d50d8b).
